| Course Purpose:              |      | Study contemporary topics in security. Topics in this fast-moving field change from year to year, but each offering will introduce these core fundamentals: confidentiality, integrity, availability, access control, and defensive programming techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Learning Objectives:         |      | Learn fundamental security concepts covering multiple domains through lectures and gain practical, hands-on experience by doing in-class exercises and labs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**University of Portland’s Code of Academic Integrity**
Academic integrity is openness and honesty in all scholarly endeavors. The University of Portland is a scholarly community dedicated to the discovery, investigation, and dissemination of truth, and to the development of the whole person. Membership in this community is a privilege, requiring each person to practice academic integrity at its highest level, while expecting and promoting the same in others.

**Assessment Disclosure Statement**

**Accessibility Statement**
The University of Portland endeavors to make its courses and services fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a disability are also encouraged to use the services of the Office for Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic Resource Center (503-943-8985). If you have an AES Accommodation Plan, you should make an appointment to meet with your faculty member to discuss how to implement your plan in this class.

Also, you should meet with your faculty member to discuss emergency medical information or how best to ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other emergency.

**Mental Health Statement**
As a college student, you may sometimes experience problems with your mental health that interfere with academic experiences and negatively impact daily life. If you or someone you know experiences mental health challenges at UP, please contact the University of Portland Health and Counseling Center in Orrico Hall (down the hill from Franz Hall and Mehling Hall) at www.up.edu/healthcenter or at 503-943-7134.

**Non-Violence Statement**
The University of Portland is committed to fostering a community free from all forms of violence in which all members feel safe and respected.
